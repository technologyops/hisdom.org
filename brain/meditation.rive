    - Meditation as the Eastern part of the world is understood completely wrong. Thoughtless state of mind is meditation they say and ask you to be thoughtless. Do you see that being thoughtless is also a thought. Thought operates in the field of known and how can you see the unknown. 
    - Meditation classes, schools, meditation based on mantra is all rubbish. How can you search for unknown in the field of known which is knowledge. If you think you will control your thought, then do you see that it is also a thought. What happens when the mind naturally becomes thoughtless unless needed? Can such a mind ever exist?
    - What is the quality of mind which operates on knowledge when it is absolutely needed such as taking a bus, etc but doesn't operate in relationships such as judgment, prejudice, manipulative? Can the thought makes it possible. Obviously it isn't because thoughts creates more division which becomes infinitely divisible. 
    - The word meditation has created such hype in the western society by the eastern society. So called 'Gurus' from east visit western society teaching Mantras and all the rubbish as meditation charging money. That isn't really meditation. People's want to experience the unknown through the known is the reason for all this. 
    - Meditation is something in a different dimension. The want of experience of enlightenment is more than the enlightenment itself. So the first thing we want to know is how to meditate. But I would rather say the approach should be to understand 'What is meditation?' not how to meditate.
